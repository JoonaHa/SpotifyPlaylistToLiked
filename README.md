# SpotifyPlaylistToLiked
Import any of your playlists to your library or 'Liked Songs' while keeping the original order.
The need for this arise when Spotfy changed from 'Starred tracks' to the 'Your library' and 'Liked songs' system.
I needed to import Starred tracks to my library in the original adding order.

This Python-projects solves it by improting the songs from a chosen playlist while adding a timeout while adding indidual songs.
The default timeout is 1 second, because the Spotify-API timestamps only support one second precision.
